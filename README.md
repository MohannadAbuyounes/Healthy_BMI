# Healthy_BMI App

The images below show that the application serves all members of the community who are concerned about their health, as it shows you your body mass and gives you tips about the ideal mass and weight for your height. It also enables you to maintain your body mass and calculate it from time to time, by taking the advice that the application gives you based on the knowledge and study of the nutrition doctor.

In this app, I used a lot of flutter packages, including:
1) Files were created for each widget for reuse
2) url_launcher
3) font_awesome_flutter
4) fluttertoast
5) Shared_preferences
6) Component and constance file (to not duplicate widgets)
7) Lots of widgets.
